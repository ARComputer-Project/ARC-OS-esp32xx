# Autonommous Radio Computer (or Anarchist's Radio Computer) Operating System.

Next-gen open-source device with capabilities of the real computer or smartphone but also with access to the censorship-free decentralised web (ARC-Network).
ARC-NET will support most popular MESH radio protocols and also will implement it's own protocol on top of them that will allow access to the Internet (slow) via MESH networks. Future plans also include adding support for decentralised web-resources inside the network, gateways to the smartphones to allow usage of proprietary apps, SDK for convenient apps development and more!
